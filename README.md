# Why Frameworks Matter

The repository features different libraries/frameworks which solve the same problem: Search stories from [Hacker News](https://hn.algolia.com/api) and show the result in a list in a browser. It should showcase how the same thing can be achieved with different solutions. But most important it should show why we don't build large applications with vanilla JavaScript anymore.
